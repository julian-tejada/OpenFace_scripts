# OpenFace_scripts
R scripts to process data from OpenFace.

Openface is a project created by Tadas Baltrusaitis to development a facial behavior analyslis toolkit which stimated the identification and intensity of almost all Facial Action Units (FACS) which can be used to identify the seven basic emotions. 
Here, I prepared a R script to load the data resulting of the Openface FeatureExtraction command and stimated the intensity of detection of each one of the seven basic emotions.
